## Problem

### 1.   77% of millennials have never cooked a Sunday roast, and just a third know how to make family classics like spaghetti bolognaise or shepherd’s pie.

When you are in college and living far away from your parents, you have to learn to make your own sandwich, use the cooker, fix a meal, and do more. Learning to cook will help you understand world cultures, customs and flavors. You will also learn life skills like eating healthy, budgeting your money, and cleaning. Save some cash. Cooking is less expensive than eating at restaurants, fast food joints and school cafeterias.

### 2.  60% of college students spend time texting 94.6 minutes on average, With how much we text on a daily basis, it’s inevitable to encounter an awkward texting conversation now and then.
